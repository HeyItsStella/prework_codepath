# Prework - Unknown

Submitted by: Stella Chen
....(I might've used a different name in the application by mistake because of auto populate )

Unknown is an app that... [TODO] 

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a randomly generated gradient color

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Discord
    * Roles and permissions: which ensures controlled access to different channels and features based on user roles
    * Bots: supports third-party bots that can be added to servers to automate tasks
    * Integration with other platforms: users are able to see other's statuses such as what music they're listening to and what games they're playing
2. Forest
    * Virtual planning: while the timer is running, a virtual plant begins to grow
    * Gamification: the app gamifies the process of productivity. Successfully completing focused sessions helps you collect coins, which can be used to buy new plants.
    * Brower extension: in addition to the mobile app, there is also a browser extension that helps you stay focused while browsing on your computer
3. IOS Calendar
    * Intuitive interface: clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy to view, add, and manage events
    * Multiple calendars: users can create and manage multiple calendars for different aspects of their lives
    * Color-coding: users can assign different colors to calendars and events
    * Event Attachment: Attach files, documents, and photos to events for easy reference
    * Share calendars: users can share their calendars with others
    * Search: search function that helps you quickly find events by keywords, data, or titles
    * Collective view of all the upcoming events in chronological order
  
I would like to build an app that will be able to take advantage of the current IOS calendar app and provide some productivity-related functionalities. For example, users can create an ideal schedule on the app, and record their daily activities on the calendar. The app will make comparisons between the ideal schedule and the activities recorded on the calendar to provide feedback and score. Measures for calculating the score have not been decided yet. Maybe we can provide two evaluation methods, one by how closely they're following the ideal schedule based on time, and another one is more like how much time is dedicated to specific tasks in total.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
